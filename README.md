# Falcon-LLM-Local-Execution-with-LangChain

📌 Falcon LLM Local Deployment Guide

🚀 This project walks you through the process of setting up and running Falcon LLM (7B) locally using LangChain and its Prompt Template and ConversationChain functionalities.
📖 Overview

This repository provides step-by-step guidance on:
✔️ Setting up the required environment
✔️ Downloading the Falcon 7B model & tokenizer from Hugging Face
✔️ Configuring model parameters for efficient execution
✔️ Creating a conversation chain with LangChain
✔️ Modifying Prompt Templates for custom interactions
✔️ Managing conversation history with ConversationBufferWindowMemory

🏗 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Set Up the Environment – Install dependencies
2️⃣ Download Falcon 7B Model – Fetch the model and tokenizer from Hugging Face
3️⃣ Configure Model & Generation Parameters – Optimize performance settings
4️⃣ Build a Conversation Chain – Integrate LangChain for structured interaction
5️⃣ Modify Prompt Template – Customize the conversational style
6️⃣ Manage Conversation History – Use ConversationBufferWindowMemory
7️⃣ Run & Test the Model – Interact with Falcon LLM locally

📌 Key Features

🔹 Local Execution – Run Falcon 7B without cloud dependencies
🔹 Optimized Performance – Uses bitsandbytes for 8-bit inference
🔹 Customizable Prompts – Define conversation styles via LangChain
🔹 Memory Management – Implement session history tracking
